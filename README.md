I developed a Java-based Car Rental System, creating classes for Cars, Customers, and Rentals. I led the implementation of key functionalities in the CarRentalSystem class, managing the addition of cars/customers, overseeing rental processes, and handling returns. This demonstrated my advanced proficiency in Java, emphasizing my skills in object-oriented design and delivering robust system solutions.
